In this section, we will briefly illustrate some approaches that have been taken to bootstrapping the model defined by \ref{eq:matrix_model_hamiltonian}. We will mostly follow \cite{adsmatrix}.

The bootstrap approach works well for this case because
\begin{itemize}
    \item In contrast with methods like Monte-Carlo, Euclidean signature sign problems are of no concern.
    \item We can work in limits where $N\rightarrow\infty$ directly but can also deal with finite N cases.
    \item The method is non-perturbative/works with strong coupling.
\end{itemize}
As we saw before, we can produce rigorous inequalities for the values of observables, provided we can deal with the steeply increasing computational cost.

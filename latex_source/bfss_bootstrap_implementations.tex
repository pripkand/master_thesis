There has been a lot of recent work focusing on both \ref{eq:matrix_model_hamiltonian} and other matrix models when it comes to bootstrapping. Recent work done in \cite{bootstrap_bfss_1} derived non-trivial bounds on $\langle\text{Tr}X^2\rangle$ as well as improving Polchinski's Virial Theorem bound \cite{polchinski_virial}. A more in depth implementation can be found in \cite{bootstrap_bfss_2} which utilizes SO(9) block decomposition (for an introduction on this refer to \cite{adsmatrix} section 6.4.1)

Implementations on other matrix models can be found in \cite{matrix_bootstrap_1}(application to random matrix models), \cite{matrix_boostrap_2} (application to multi-matrix models), \cite{matrix_bootstrap_3} (bootstrap used for finding critical exponents in matrix theories) and more.

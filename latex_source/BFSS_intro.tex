Having seen how the quantum mechanical bootstrap works in some simple examples for both the 0 temperature case and the thermal case, we will now shift to why and how this technique can be of interest for High Energy Physics by focusing on the BFSS conjecture and its relation to Matrix Theory.
We will outline a derivation of getting from a non-abelian extension of the DBI action to the Matrix Model by following the derivations done in \cite{Mxintro}. We also consulted \cite{Matrix,adsmatrix}. For reviews on the Matrix Model refer to \cite{Mxintro,Taylor,adsmatrix,Matrix} and for a more complete treatise of matrix theories refer to \cite{matrices_book}.

Stated, the conjecture reads:

"[...]M-theory in the infinite momentum frame is exactly equivalent to the $N\rightarrow \infty$ limit of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics
described by [of 10D SYM compactified to 0+1 Dimensions]. The calculation of any physical quantity in M-theory can be reduced to a calculation in matrix quantum mechanics followed by an extrapolation to large N"

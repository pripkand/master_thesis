As before, the system will be constrained by the Schwinger-Dyson equation but we will be interested in its application to single trace operators i.e.:
\begin{equation}
    \langle[H,\text{Tr}\mathcal{O}]\rangle_\beta=0,\quad \mathcal{O}\in \mathcal{B}_L
\end{equation}
With the Hankel Matrix changing accordingly to:
\begin{equation}
    (M^{(L)})_{ij}:=\langle\text{Tr}\mathcal{O}_i\mathcal{O}_j\rangle_\beta,\quad \mathcal{O}_{i,j}\in\mathcal{B}_L
\end{equation}
While before we only had the canonical commutation relations, now we also have the cyclicity of the trace over the SU(N) indices of the matrices. For the thermal case, as before, we just need to also impose the KMS condition in much the same way as it was done above.
One can also include SUSY constraints by noting that
\begin{equation}
    \{\mathcal{Q}_a,\mathcal{Q}_b\}\propto \delta_{ab} H
\end{equation}
meaning we can bootstrap a SUSY invariant state by imposing:
\begin{equation}
    \langle\mathcal{Q}_a\mathcal{O}\rangle_\beta=\langle\mathcal{O}\mathcal{Q}_a\rangle_\beta=0
\end{equation}

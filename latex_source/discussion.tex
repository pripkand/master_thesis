Motivated by its application to the matrix model of the BFSS conjecture, we illustrated the idea of the quantum mechanical non-negative bootstrap in a few simple cases for both 0 temperature and thermal cases and saw that the bootstrap method using SDPs can yield satisfying results for modest computational power. We outlined some arguments for getting to the matrix model Hamiltonian \ref{eq:matrix_model_hamiltonian} through the BFSS conjecture and mentioned how the bootstrap methodology could be applied to it.  
\paragraph{Potential Directions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We would have liked to do a bootstrap of the matrix model ourselves, preferably in the thermal case, trying either the SDP route as illustrated or using QICS\cite{QICS}.
    \item We would, also, like to try implementations in other cases such as CFTs or Yang-Mills theories.
    \item Refine the code that was used to cover more cases and serve better as an introduction to the area.
\end{itemize}
